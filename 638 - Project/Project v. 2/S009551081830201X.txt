Abstract: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects over 1000 babies born in the United States each year. 4% to 10% of infant deaths from all congenital anomalies are caused by diaphragmatic hernias. Survivors often suffer significant morbidity. When compared with trauma, cancer, and AIDS, it is clear that this birth defect represents a significant public health problem for children.
