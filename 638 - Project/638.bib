abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics , some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in textbooks , but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

abstract = {The Turing, or reaction-diffusion (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated. O ver the past three decades, studies at the molecular level have revealed that a wide range of physiological phenomena are regulated by complex networks of cellular or molecular interactions (1). The complexity of such networks gives rise to new problems, however, as the behavior of such systems often defies immediate or intuitive understanding. Mathematical approaches can help facilitate the understanding of complex systems, and to date, these approaches have taken two primary forms. The first involves analyzing every element of a network quantitatively and simulating all interactions by computation (1). This strategy is effective in relatively simple systems, such as the metabolic pathway in a single cell, and is extensively explored in the field of systems biology. However, for more complex systems in which spatiotemporal parameters take on importance, it becomes almost impossible to make a meaningful prediction. A second strategy, one that includes simple mathematical modeling in which the details of the system are omitted, can be more effective in extracting the nature of the complex system (2). The reaction-diffusion (RD) model (3) proposed by Alan Turing is a masterpiece of this sort of mathematical modeling, one that can explain how spatial patterns develop autonomously. In the RD model, Turing used a simple system of "two diffusible substances interacting with each other" to represent patterning mechanisms in the embryo and found that such systems can generate spatial patterns autonomously. The most revolutionary feature of the RD model is its introduction of a "reaction" that produces the ligands (morphogens). If "diffusion" alone is at work, local sources of morphogens are needed to form the gradient. In such cases, the positional information made by the system is dependent on the prepattern (Fig. 1, A and B). By introducing the reaction, the system gains the ability to generate various patterns independent of the pre-pattern (Fig. 1C). Unfortunately, Turing died soon after publishing this seminal paper, but simulation studies of the model have shown that this system can replicate most biological spatial patterns (4-6). Later, a number of mathematical models (4) were proposed, but most followed Turing's basic idea that "the mutual interaction of elements results in spontaneous pattern formation ." The RD model is now recognized as a standard among mathematical theories that deal with biological pattern formation. However, this model has yet to gain wide acceptance among experimental biologists. One reason is the gap between the mathematical simplicity of the model and the complexity of the real world. The hypothetical molecules in the original RD model have been so idealized for the purposes of mathematical analysis that it seems nearly impossible to adapt the model directly to the complexity of real biological systems. However , this is a misunderstanding to which experimental researchers tend to succumb. The logic of pattern formation can be understood with simple models, and by adapting this logic to complex biological phenomena, it becomes easier to extract the essence of the underlying mechanisms. Genomic data and new analytic technologies have shifted the target of developmental research from the identification of molecules to understanding the behavior of complex networks, making the RD model even more important as a tool for theoretical analysis.

(B) Adding a second morphogen produces a relatively complex pattern; but with no interactions between the morphogens, the system is not self-regulating.

abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto-and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto-and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution, Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and mono-molecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantitative data on hydra-a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation-and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation.},

abstract = {Development of spatial patterns in multicellular organisms depends on gradients in the concentration of signaling molecules that control gene expression. In the Drosophila embryo, Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen controls cell fate along 70{\%} of the anteropos-terior axis but is translated from mRNA localized at the anterior pole. Gradients of Bcd and other morphogens are thought to arise through diffusion, but this basic assumption has never been rigorously tested in living embryos. Furthermore, because diffusion sets a relationship between length and time scales, it is hard to see how patterns of gene expression established by diffusion would scale proportionately as egg size changes during evolution. Here, we show that the motion of inert molecules through the embryo is well described by the diffusion equation on the relevant length and time scales, and that effective diffusion constants are essentially the same in closely related dipteran species with embryos of very different size. Nonetheless, patterns of gene expression in these different species scale with egg length. We show that this scaling can be traced back to scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Our results, together with constraints imposed by the time scales of development, suggest that the mechanism for scaling is a species-specific adaptation of the Bcd lifetime. bicoid morphogen dipteran evolution O ne of the classic challenges for models of embryonic development is the problem of scaling: Although organisms vary substantially in size, the variations in proportion are much less significant, and in cases where the fully developed organism has a segmented structure the number of segments often is invariant across a wide range of sizes. In well studied systems such as Drosophila, segmented structures have their origin in spatially periodic patterns of gene expression that are visible at early stages of embryonic development, and the emergence of these patterns has been described, at varying levels of detail, in terms of the diffusion and interaction of the relevant ''morpho-gen'' molecules (1-3). In nonbiological systems governed by similar equations, the spatial scale of patterns is set by local parameters analogous to the diffusion constants and reaction rates; hence, when we change the size of the system, the dimensions of the stripes remain fixed and the number of stripes changes (4). How then are we to understand the scaling of segment size and the conservation of their number in the biological case? Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster and a set of closely related dipteran species as model systems in which to address this problem. Anteroposterior patterning in the Drosophila embryo is controlled by gradients in the concentration of maternal gene products that arise soon after fertilization. These protein molecules establish broad domains of gene expression that interact to establish final segmentation. One of the best studied maternal determinants in Drosophila is bicoid (bcd) (5). Bcd RNA is deposited during oogenesis at the anterior pole of the egg. After fertilization, the RNA is translated and a Bcd protein gradient is established along the anteroposterior axis of the egg. Subsequently, Bcd acts as a transcription factor, regulating genes such as hunchback, kr{\"{u}}ppel, and even-skipped in a concentration-dependent manner (6), and these gene products feed into a regulatory circuit that generates striped patterns of expression of the gap and pair rule genes (cf. Fig. 2). The Bcd gradient is established in a syncytium, where nuclei replicate without intervening cell division (7), and the size of the embryo stays constant, so that pattern formation is independent of growth. The absence of cell membranes would seem to provide an ideal environment for diffusion-based gradient formation. On the other hand, visual observation of the developing embryo reveals contractions of the egg cortex and large-scale cytoplasmic motions occurring with each mitotic cycle, raising questions about whether the relevant movement of any molecule can be described by simple diffusion. Parallel to the question of whether diffusion is a good description of molecular motion in the embryo is the question of scaling. Certainly, related species of flies have similarly scaled proportions in their body plans, but relatively little is known about the underlying pattern of gene expression in the embryo. One can imagine, for example, scaling of body plan without scaling of the Bcd gradient itself, by changing the rules that the downstream genes use in responding to this gradient. Here, we address both questions. To test the validity of the diffusion model, we use microinjections of inert, f luorescent molecules to probe and measure diffusive properties of em-bryonic cytoplasm of various dipteran species. To test for scaling, we use immunof luorescence stainings to compare Bcd gene expression profiles in those species. Our findings show that these different measurements, taken together, strongly constrain models for the formation and readout of the Bcd gradient. Methods Antibody Staining. Embryos were selected from early interphase of cell cycle 14, i.e., before significant membrane invagination, and the images were focused at mid-embryo to avoid geometric distortion. All species were stained with antibodies raised against D. melanogaster (8). For the Lucilia sericata and D. melanogaster embryos in Fig. 2 A, we used rabbit anti-paired, guinea pig anti-runt, guinea pig anti-hunchback, and rat anti-giant. For the D. melanogaster and Drosophila busckii embryos in Fig. 2B, we used rat anti-hunchback and guinea pig anti-runt. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, with Zeiss 10 (N.A. 0.45) and 20 (N.A. 0.6) air objectives. Diffusion Measurements. Dextran particles were purchased from Molecular Probes (10, 40, and 70 kDa) and Sigma-Aldrich (150 kDa). Corresponding hydrodynamic radii, r s , were taken from ref. 9 and ref. 10, respectively.
